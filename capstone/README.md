# Capstone

The Posts/Users System is a full-stack capstone project built with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui, Redux, Express, JWT authentication, and MongoDB. It delivers a clean, responsive interface with pagination, filtering, and sorting baked in.

Users can register or log in, receive a JWT auth token, and move through protected routes that mirror real-world app flows. Once inside, each user can create, read, update, and delete their own posts, while being safely restricted from modifying anyone else’s content.

**NOTE:** You can also make use of the Postman collection included in the project. It’s exported in JSON v2.1 format and can be imported directly into Postman API from the path `./backend/capstone.postman_collection.json`.
